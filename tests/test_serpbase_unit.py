"""Unit tests for the SerpBase search provider.

SerpBase is second in the selection order and, until this module existed, was
executed by **no test in the tree** -- a whole provider's response parsing with
nothing asserting it. The layout mirrors the other provider modules: the request
shape and the parsing here, the transport-level failures (401, 429, a non-JSON
body, a wrong-shaped JSON body and a timeout) in
``test_search_provider_error_paths.py``, which drives all seven providers from one
table.

**Written in pytest style, like ``test_serply_unit.py`` and unlike its other five
sibling provider modules**, which are
``TestCase`` subclasses. Not a stylistic preference: ``scripts/check_plan_dag.py``
rejects a new ``unittest``-style module that no migration batch claims, and the
batch converting the provider tests to pytest has not run yet. Adding a sixth
``unittest`` module would mean enlarging that batch to convert a file written
after the decision to stop writing them. The guard is what surfaced this.

That guard reads the file as **text**, framework imports and class bases alike,
so spelling the framework name next to ``TestCase`` anywhere in this module --
this docstring included -- puts it back in the batch's scope. Measured.

SerpBase authenticates with an ``X-API-Key`` header, so the request case pins
both that credential placement and the JSON request body.
